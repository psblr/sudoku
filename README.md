# Sudoku Web Game
A little sudoku web game developed by psblr. By clicking the Button ```Load New Game``` a new (random) game gets loaded from the file ```data.json```. To solve the Sudoku you have three tries, which are indicated by the three green circles above the sudoku grid. 

To have a little bit more fun coding the project, I implemented a simple backtracking algorithm that is able to solve the sudoku. By pressing the button ```Solve``` this algorithm gets executed and the sudoku is being solved. The steps of the algorithm are visible in the sudoku grid.

I hope you have fun playing sudoku! If there are any issues regarding functionality please contact me. I am aware that some functionalities are upgradeable, but there was no time to fix them. (hopefully in the future tho)

I assume the rest is pretty self explanatory.
